    <h1>Top 3 Movies of All Time According to Mark</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

    <hr />

    <h3>Life of Pi</h3>
    <p>
      Whenever someone asks me what my favorite movie is, there is not a single time that I didn't think of Life of Pi.
      The story revolves around 2 characters, a kid and a lion, who are stuck together in a lifeboat. With the threat of
      a big lion just waiting to eat the boy alive, Pi must find a way to survive. Admittedly, I don't remember much
      from this movie, and there is a possibility that I've enjoyed other movies way more than this. But there is no
      denying the impact this movie had on me, seeing a kid survive on his own with an apex predator. Especially since I
      was only around 8 years old back then. I can't help but relate to the character.

    <h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
    <p>
      As a Marvel's fan, you should have seen this one coming. Avengers: Endgame (and Avengers, Infinity War) are
      undoutedly peak Marvel. I just love how Marvel was able to bring all these previously unrelated characters
      together to fight against a common greater enemy. The cinematography and writing for this movie was phenomenal and
      you can see that the movie staff really poured their hearts out on this one. I daresay that there might be no
      other Marvel movie that can top this one off. Definitely worth the hype it garnered and will always live up to our
      expectation.

    <h3>Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms</h3>
    <p>
      This one, I don't remember much as well. But I have no regrets watching it. I can't say that it's the best anime
      movie out there, but it definitely holds a very strong and large place in my heart. Watching this movie while my
      mother was sleeping beside me made my bawl my eyes out. The way Maquia dedicated her life to taking care of a boy
      and the hardships she went through as a single mother to provide and care for her unbiological son made me feel
      things which made me cry like a mad baby. Would love to watch this again when I have the time.
